### 🚨 Important Note 🚨
#### Due to an incomplete feature in the current version:
- The **PHP Add In** button is not functioning as expected. Clicking the button will prepend `http://localhost` to the URL, which won't work properly.
- **Solution**: Do not click the button! Instead, **copy the link** generated and **paste it directly into your browser**. 
  - Sorry for the inconvenience! 😔 This feature will be completed very soon!
